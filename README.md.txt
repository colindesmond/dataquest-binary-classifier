# Dataquest ML Capstone Project

This project is the capstone for [Dataquest's](https://www.dataquest.io/) machine learning course. 

Using 2007 loan data from [Lending Club](www.lendingclub.com), our goal is to build a ML model that predicts whether a loan will be paid off on time. 

We are viewing the problem from the standpoint of a conservative investor. By that, we mean we are more interested in a low False Positive Rate (FPR) than a high True Positive Rate (TPR). Specifically, our goal is a model with TPR>50% and FPR<7%.
